## 🧠 How It Works

### Advanced Pressure Detection System

TrackWeight employs a sophisticated multi-layered approach to trackpad pressure sensing:

#### **Primary Method: Open Multi-Touch Support**
- Utilizes enhanced Open Multi-Touch Support library integration
- Direct access to private macOS multitouch APIs
- Captures detailed pressure data from multiple touch points simultaneously
- Provides the highest accuracy and sensitivity

#### **Fallback Method: Force Touch Events**
- NSEvent-based Force Touch monitoring for compatibility
- Ensures functionality across all supported MacBook models
- Automatic fallback when multitouch access is unavailable

#### **Smart Pressure Processing**
- **Capacitance Detection**: Pressure readings only available with finger contact on trackpad
- **Multi-point Aggregation**: Combines pressure from multiple simultaneous touches
- **Real-time Calibration**: Continuous drift compensation and environmental adjustment
- **Noise Filtering**: Advanced algorithms to eliminate measurement noise

### Weight Calculation Algorithm

```
Raw Pressure → Calibration Offset → Environmental Compensation → Weight (grams)
```

Our extensive testing reveals that **MultitouchSupport pressure data is pre-calibrated in grams**, providing exceptional accuracy without complex conversion algorithms.
